  <h1>CI H5P SCORM Packager 1.0</h1>
  <p>
    This utility allows you to package H5P files into SCORM 1.2 files. It's licensed under the MIT license and the
    source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/JFlaherty347/scorm-h5p-wrapper">GitHub</a>. It is a modification
    of the original found <a href="https://github.com/sr258/scorm-h5p-wrapper">here</a>.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>To package a H5P file into a SCORM package, select a file from your disk and click on "Package". Your browser will
    then download the SCORM package as a zip file. You can put this zip file into a LMS of your choice.<br /> <i>Note:
      Your H5P file is uploaded to the server of this utility during the packaging process!</i>

    <p>
      <b>Advantages</b> of packaging H5P content into SCORM (in comparison to embedding from external sites or using
      the
      built-in H5P module of your LMS):
      <ul>
        <li>You can use H5P in any LMS that supports SCORM.</li>
        <li>Scores are reported to the LMS through SCORM.</li>
        <li>You don't have to rely on external sites (privacy concerns, availability).</li>
        <li>You can use H5P content types which are not available in your LMS.</li>
        <li>Your content will never change, so updates to the H5P core or libraries won't affect it.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Disadvantages</b> of packing H5P content into SCORM:
      <ul>
        <li>Users don't benefit from caching H5P library files across content. This means that all JavaScript, HTML and
          CSS files have to be downloaded for each package. If the LMS server is a bit slow, this can lead to
          noticeable delays in loading the content.</li>
        <li>You can't use the H5P Editor in your LMS to quickly change the content. You have to store your H5P files in
          a separate place and edit your content on <a href="https://h5p.org">H5P.org or on another CMS that supports
            H5P (like a local <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> or
            <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> installation)</li>
        <li>You don't benefit from updates to H5P libraries or the core.</li>
        <li>The packages are a bit bigger as they include the h5p-standalone library.</li>
      </ul>
      As a conclusion, <b>you should only package H5P into SCORM if there are compelling reasons to do so and if you
        know what you are doing</b>! If you have administrative rights on your LMS and there is a H5P module for it, you
      should
      certainly install this module and upload your content the regular way.
